Enjoy the beloved SquidSMP Season 2 spawn as your Minecraft main menu background!

## Where to download

Go to releases to download any version, or access the latest version [here](https://github.com/OrsaMC/squidsmp-s2-panorama/releases/latest).

Then, simply put the zip in your resource packs folder.

## Respackopts highly recommended

I highly recommend that you install [Respackopts](https://modrinth.com/mod/respackopts).

With this mod, you'll be able to change a few parameters, such as the resource pack used or whether shaders are on.
